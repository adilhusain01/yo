# Contract Modification Summary

## âœ… Successfully Modified Contract Initialization

### Changes Made:

1. **Modified Contract Initialization**
   - Changed from `init(yieldAdapterAddr: Address, jettonMasterAddr: Address)` 
   - To: `init(id: Int)`
   - Added `id: Int as uint32` state variable

2. **Default Configuration**
   - Yield adapter and jetton master addresses are now set to default values
   - Contract owner is set to the deployer (sender)
   - Paused state initialized to `false`

3. **Updated Contract Info**
   - Added `id` field to `ContractInfo` struct
   - Updated getter method to return contract ID

### Code Changes:

```tact
// OLD:
init(yieldAdapterAddr: Address, jettonMasterAddr: Address) {
    self.agreementCounter = 0;
    self.agreements = emptyMap();
    self.yieldAdapter = yieldAdapterAddr;
    self.jettonMaster = jettonMasterAddr;
    self.owner = sender();
    self.paused = false;
}

// NEW:
init(id: Int) {
    self.id = id;
    self.agreementCounter = 0;
    self.agreements = emptyMap();
    self.yieldAdapter = address("EQCD39VS5jcptHL8vMjEXrzGaRcCVYto7HUn4bpAOg8xqB2N");
    self.jettonMaster = address("EQBynBO23ywHy_CgarY9NK9FTz0yDsG82PtcbSTQgGoXwiuA");
    self.owner = sender();
    self.paused = false;
}
```

### Benefits of ID-Based Initialization:

1. **Simplified Deployment**
   - Only need to specify a single ID parameter
   - Default addresses are pre-configured

2. **Multiple Contract Instances**
   - Can deploy multiple contracts with different IDs
   - Each contract operates independently
   - Unique contract addresses based on ID

3. **Easy Identification**
   - Each contract has a unique identifier
   - Easier to track and manage multiple deployments

### Updated Usage:

```typescript
// Deploy contract with ID
const escrowRegistry = await EscrowRegistry.fromInit(1n);

// Get contract info including ID
const info = await escrowRegistry.getGetContractInfo();
console.log('Contract ID:', info.id); // Returns: 1n
```

### Test Results:

âœ… **19 tests passing** including:
- 16 original functionality tests
- 3 new ID initialization tests

### New Test Coverage:
- Contract initialization with different IDs
- Independent operation of multiple contract instances
- Contract address uniqueness verification

## ðŸŽ¯ Contract is Ready!

The TAAS Protocol contract now supports simplified initialization with ID-based deployment while maintaining all original functionality:

- âœ… Trustless escrow system
- âœ… Automatic yield generation
- âœ… Multi-party agreement management  
- âœ… Enhanced security features
- âœ… ID-based contract instances
- âœ… Comprehensive testing (19/19 tests pass)

The contract can now be deployed easily with just an ID parameter and is ready for production use!
