# TAAS Protocol - Trust-as-a-Service Smart Contract

A decentralized escrow system for rental agreements on the TON blockchain, built with Blueprint framework and Tact smart contract language.

## Overview

TAAS (Trust-as-a-Service) Protocol enables trustless rental agreements where security deposits are automatically staked to generate yield during the rental term. The protocol ensures both landlords and tenants benefit from a transparent, automated escrow system.

## Key Features

### üîí **Trustless Escrow System**
- Automated deposit management
- Smart contract-enforced terms
- Multi-party agreement validation

### üí∞ **Yield Generation**
- Security deposits are automatically staked
- 5% APY yield generation (configurable)
- Principal returned to tenant, yield to landlord

### üéõÔ∏è **Administrative Controls**
- Owner-controlled pause/unpause functionality
- Agreement cancellation (before deposit)
- Event emissions for tracking

### üìä **Comprehensive Tracking**
- Agreement status management
- Creation timestamps
- Event logging for all major actions

## Agreement Lifecycle

```
1. Draft (0) ‚Üí Landlord creates agreement
2. Accepted (1) ‚Üí Tenant accepts terms
3. DepositReceived (2) ‚Üí Deposit received by contract
4. DepositStaked (3) ‚Üí Deposit automatically staked for yield
5. Completed (4) ‚Üí Term ended, funds distributed
6. Cancelled (5) ‚Üí Agreement cancelled (only before deposit)
```

## Smart Contract Architecture

### Core Contract: `EscrowRegistry`

**Initialization:**
The contract is initialized with a unique ID that allows for multiple contract instances:
```tact
init(id: Int) {
    self.id = id;
    // ... other initialization
}
```

**State Variables:**
- `id`: Unique identifier for the contract instance (uint32)
- `agreementCounter`: Total number of agreements created
- `agreements`: Map of agreement ID to Agreement struct
- `yieldAdapter`: Address of yield generation service (default set)
- `jettonMaster`: Address of USDT/stablecoin contract (default set)
- `owner`: Contract owner address
- `paused`: Emergency pause state

### Message Types

#### `CreateAgreement`
Creates a new rental agreement.
```typescript
{
  tenant: Address;
  depositAmount: bigint;
  rentAmount: bigint;
  startDate: bigint;
  termLength: bigint;
}
```

#### `AcceptAgreement`
Tenant accepts the agreement terms.
```typescript
{
  agreementId: bigint;
}
```

#### `DepositReceived`
Triggered when deposit is received (keeper bot).
```typescript
{
  agreementId: bigint;
  amount: bigint;
}
```

#### `ClaimAtTermEnd`
Processes agreement completion and fund distribution.
```typescript
{
  agreementId: bigint;
}
```

#### `CancelAgreement`
Cancels agreement before deposit is made.
```typescript
{
  agreementId: bigint;
}
```

#### `SetPaused`
Emergency pause control (owner only).
```typescript
{
  paused: boolean;
}
```

### Getter Methods

- `getAgreement(agreementId)`: Get specific agreement details
- `getAgreementCounter()`: Get total agreement count
- `getContractInfo()`: Get contract metadata and statistics

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

```bash
npm install -g @ton/blueprint
```

### Clone and Install

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd taas-protocol/contract
npm install
```

## Development Commands

### Build Contract
```bash
npm run build
# or
npx blueprint build
```

### Run Tests
```bash
npm test
```

### Run Demo
```bash
npm run demo
```

### Deploy Contract
```bash
npm run deploy
# or
npx blueprint run deployTaas
```

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive test suites:

### Basic Functionality Tests (`Taas.spec.ts`)
- Contract deployment
- Agreement creation and acceptance
- Deposit processing and staking
- Term completion and claiming
- Error handling and validation

### Enhanced Features Tests (`Enhanced.spec.ts`)
- Contract information retrieval
- Parameter validation
- Agreement cancellation
- Pause/unpause functionality
- Ownership controls
- Timestamp tracking

### Run All Tests
```bash
npm test
```

Expected output:
```
Test Suites: 2 passed, 2 total
Tests:       16 passed, 16 total
```

## Demo Workflow

Run the interactive demo to see the complete protocol workflow:

```bash
npm run demo
```

The demo demonstrates:
1. Contract deployment
2. Agreement creation by landlord
3. Agreement acceptance by tenant
4. Deposit processing and staking
5. Term completion and fund distribution

## Contract Deployment

### Testnet Deployment

1. Configure your wallet in Blueprint
2. Update yield adapter and jetton master addresses in deployment script
3. Run deployment:

```bash
npx blueprint run deployTaas --testnet
```

### Mainnet Deployment

```bash
npx blueprint run deployTaas --mainnet
```

## Security Features

### Input Validation
- Positive amounts required for deposits and rent
- Future start dates only
- Non-zero term lengths
- Address validation

### Access Controls
- Only tenants can accept agreements
- Only parties can cancel agreements
- Only owner can pause contract
- Time-locked claim mechanisms

### Emergency Controls
- Contract pause functionality
- Agreement cancellation (before deposit)
- Owner-controlled emergency stops

## Gas Costs

Typical gas costs for operations:

- Deploy Contract: ~0.05 TON
- Create Agreement: ~0.05 TON
- Accept Agreement: ~0.05 TON
- Process Deposit: ~0.05 TON
- Claim at Term End: ~0.05 TON

## Integration Examples

### Frontend Integration

```typescript
import { EscrowRegistry } from './build/Taas/Taas_EscrowRegistry';
import { toNano } from '@ton/core';

// Initialize contract with unique ID
const contractId = 1n; // Choose unique ID for your deployment
const escrowRegistry = provider.open(
  await EscrowRegistry.fromInit(contractId)
);

// Create agreement
await escrowRegistry.send(
  landlord.getSender(),
  { value: toNano('0.05') },
  {
    $$type: 'CreateAgreement',
    tenant: tenantAddress,
    depositAmount: toNano('1000'),
    rentAmount: toNano('100'),
    startDate: BigInt(Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000)),
    termLength: BigInt(365 * 24 * 60 * 60),
  }
);

// Get contract info including ID
const info = await escrowRegistry.getGetContractInfo();
console.log('Contract ID:', info.id);
```

### Event Monitoring

The contract emits events for:
- `AgreementCreated`
- `AgreementAccepted`
- `DepositStaked`
- `AgreementCompleted`

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file:

```env
YIELD_ADAPTER_ADDRESS=EQ...
JETTON_MASTER_ADDRESS=EQ...
OWNER_MNEMONIC="your wallet mnemonic"
```

### Network Configuration

Update `tact.config.json` for different networks:

```json
{
  "projects": [
    {
      "name": "Taas",
      "path": "./contracts/taas.tact",
      "output": "./build",
      "options": {
        "debug": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
